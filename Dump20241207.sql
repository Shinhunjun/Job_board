The company has established a robust product engine that leverages advances in DNA sequencing and CRISPR-based target discovery to generate breakthrough medicines that have the potential to provide deeper, more sustained benefit than today’s targeted therapies, and extend the benefit of available immuno-oncology agents. Tango Therapeutics is focused on three areas of drug development, each in well-defined patient populations currently lacking effective treatment options, and each with hallmarks of cancer that have not been targeted yet. These include: loss of tumor suppressor gene function; multiple oncogenic drivers; and immune evasion. What fuels each of Tango’s programs is an increasingly sophisticated ability to utilize synthetic lethality - the interaction between two genes that causes cell death when both are inactivated. In cancer cells, one of these genes is inactivated by mutation; the other will be inactivated by a drug. This approach leaves normal cells largely unaffected, with the potential to greatly enhance anti-tumor efficacy and reduce associated toxicity. Tango’s success will be driven by its depth of understanding of the genetic subtypes of cancer, and corresponding insights into novel drug targets and combinations uniquely relevant to each subtype. By shaping discovery efforts in this way, Tango has the potential to reach the clinic quickly, and with a clear plan for identifying the patients most likely to benefit from each new treatment, an approach that could increase both speed and probability of success in translating novel target discoveries into transformational new medicines for patients.','https://www.tangotx.com/','https://cdn.builtin.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=contain,w=200,h=200,q=100/https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/2024-02/Tango Therapeutics.jpeg'),(1808,'MFS Investment Management','For almost a century, investors have trusted MFS to achieve their investment goals because we stay true to our convictions, and to who we are as active managers.

With prices falling by 80% in less than a decade, solar power is now within reach of every American household.

Or other solar companies are not willing to sell to them. Or simply because their roof is in the shade or is not well-suited to a solar array. Our mission is to unlock the possibility of solar power for these households. With the help of transformative policies taking root in the United States, we are now in a position to do so. It\'s called \"community solar.\"​ What it means is that a household can buy solar power without having an array installed on its roof. Here\'s what we noticed: in communities all across the country, there are extraordinary organizations -- from the church down the street to the college campus across town -- that are embracing clean energy and want to bring it to their constituents. There are also households that want to go solar but do not have an easy way to do so. Finally, there are solar companies eager to find more customers.

Day Zero Diagnostics is on a mission to transform the way infectious disease diagnostics are performed by generating the stream of real-time sequencing data required to change how we track, manage and combat infectious diseases. With an enormous unmet clinical and economic need, we are targeting bloodstream infections and sepsis for our first application. The life expectancy of a patient with septic shock is 24 hours without fast effective antibiotic treatment. However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to “carpet bomb” patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

We didn’t wait for the next advance against cancer. We created it. Based on groundbreaking work conceived in the laboratory of Sir Greg Winter with the help of Professor Christian Heinis, we are pioneering the development of bicyclic peptides, or Bicycles® – a novel class of versatile, chemically synthesized medicines. Bicycles are fully synthetic short peptides constrained to form two loops which stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint is designed to confer high affinity and selectivity, and the relatively large surface area presented by the molecule allows targets to be drugged that have historically been intractable to non-biological approaches. Bicycles represent a unique therapeutic class, combining the pharmacological properties normally associated with a biologic with the manufacturing and pharmacokinetic advantages of a small molecule, yet with no signs of immunogenicity observed to date. Bicycles can be used as Bicycle conjugates to deliver toxin payloads and to precisely target local immune activation within tumors and as Bicycle T-cell modulators, which activate cytotoxic T-cells while circumventing the limitations of antibody and biologic therapies and better enabling combination therapy. Our lead product candidate, BT1718, is a Bicycle toxin conjugate currently being investigated in a Phase I/IIa open label dose escalation and expansion clinical trial sponsored by Cancer Research UK. BT1718 targets Membrane Type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), also known as MMP-14, which is highly expressed in many solid tumors. Our strategic collaborations are based on the ability of Bicycles to address a wide variety of targets.

The problem is that big child care centers are so expensive to run that they have to charge parents a ton, and there\'s still very little left over for the caregivers. This forces the best caregivers to leave child care in search of better wages, and leaves families struggling to find quality care. At NeighborSchools, we\'ve developed a new solution that puts people first. We help individual caregivers go independent, get licensed, open up micro-daycares in their homes, and work directly with families in the community. Caregivers that launch daycares on NeighborSchools earn 2-3X more than preschool teachers, even while charging parents less for child care. And children benefit from the small, intimate settings and programs led by experienced professionals. That\'s the win-win-win.

Tim was just a teenager when he was working as a lifeguard at Disney World when he suffered a spinal injury that left him confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The Morgans made a life altering decision and they hired the wrong lawyer, who was by no means qualified to take on such a large corporation and their army of lawyers.

As a firm, Archway understands that heath care isn\'t a \"one size fits all\"​ industry, and what works for one provider won\'t necessarily work for another. When we engage with a healthcare organization, our first goal is to understand the provider\'s strengths and capabilities, the populations served, their experience with improving care while reducing costs, and their performance relative to others in the market. We also know that health care is a local business, and markets evolve in very different ways, presenting different types of opportunities. These include combinations of Medicare ACO\'s, Commercial Global Capitation, Bundled Payments, Dual Eligible Programs, Medicare Advantage Plans, Medical Homes, and Complex Care Carve - Outs. Archway partners with our clients\'​ leadership to design the care and risk management programs that match their unique capabilities with targeted opportunities and partners in the market.

I imagined we could be \"amazing\"​ every day, knowing this is a goal not always achieved but always pursued. A place where talented people could gather and do big things for clients as well as make a difference to the communities important to us. WE LAUNCHED WITH A GROUP WHO SHARED A VISION. This was to be a \"new\"​ agency model, driven by a collaborative spirit. We asked, \"Can we bind our 60-year legacy to the energy and speed of today’s hi-tech world?\"​ We had $24 million in fees at our founding. Today, we have more than $85 million in fees, over 700 colleagues and 18 offices across three continents. Our Founding Managing Partners, highly respected colleagues who took the leap with me from our former agency, have been joined by the principals of other great agencies that became Finn Partner companies. So many other talented individuals are with us, too, intrigued by the idea of doing amazing things in an amazing workplace community. WE’VE MADE OUR MARK QUICKLY. Finn Partners has been named “Best New Agency,” “Best PR Agency to Work for in North America” and“Best Mid-Sized Agency of the Year” three times. Now, we’re one of the world’s largest agencies.

Whew, that’s a mouthful. In simpler terms, we help founders find cash they didn’t know they were owed. Navigating government tax credits and incentives is no easy task. Founders and business owners rarely have the bandwidth, time, or resources to pursue these programs and as a result, billions of dollars are left on the table. That’s where we come in. We take the guesswork out of government and pass the cash savings onto small businesses. But before we dive into how it works, let’s talk about the team that makes it all happen. This isn’t our first rodeo. Our founders are ex-Google employees and successful tech startup founders. Doug Ludlow, co-founder and CEO, started MainStreet as a response to the massive impact that departing big business brought on his hometown. The small businesses that remained didn’t survive for long and the economy declined along with them. This is the unfortunate truth for towns across the U.S., where many small businesses lack resources and struggle to stay afloat. At MainStreet, we want to be the small business lifeline that makes a long-standing impact on our economy. And we won’t stop until we’ve helped every small business. The IRS bookmarks $150B in annual tax credits and incentives for U.S. companies researching and developing new products (aka “R&D”). These incentives are impactful, but they’re also complex and time-consuming. Small business owners just don’t have the capacity to cut through the red tape and claim the cash they’re owed. That’s where we come in. We plug directly into their payroll software to see what they’re owed across dozens of credits. We take the guesswork out of government and pass the savings back to our customers. The best part?

We are developing cutting-edge search technology leveraging NLP and ML to automate the B2B research process on millions of small and medium businesses in the U.S. We’ve recently experienced significant growth and raised capital from top investors who built Google and transformed the finance industry. Despite making up nearly half of the US economy, private companies are notoriously difficult to find and engage even for the most innovative dealmakers. In the past, finding the right small and mid-market companies for a deal has required a massive effort, and a bit of luck. This hurts target companies too, who often miss out on game changing opportunities as they are practically invisible. So, what if there was a different, better way to do business? A solution that gave innovative dealmakers an edge? A tool to help them find the right company - at the right time? That\'s why we created Grata - to make that difference. Our private company intelligence engine streamlines the process of finding the best companies to target: making it easier and faster to gain visibility into the entire market, gather relevant intelligence on target companies, build bespoke lists, and find similar companies to uncover more of the best opportunities in less time.','https://grata.com/','https://cdn.builtin.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=contain,w=200,h=200,q=100/https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/2022-09/Grata_Mark_Artwork_Positive.png'),(5031,'Token.io','With the simplest and fastest way to launch Pay by Bank as a core payment method globally, Token.io’s complete A2A payment infrastructure helps payment providers grow their market share in the face of the continued shift from cards to APMs. Token.io delivers the highest performing and deepest connectivity in the industry, reaching 567 million bank accounts (80%+ per market) in 20 supported countries through a single API and interface.

Typical hot yoga programs heat the studio with traditional hv/ac systems or with traditional space heaters that merely heat the air in the room. This traditional type of heat makes the air harder to breath. Infrared heat is much more comfortable and more readily absorbed by the body.

We believe it should be easy for any company to hire any person, no matter where either is located in the world. Now more than ever, smart companies can\'t allow the location of their HQ to dictate the size of their talent pool. Your next transformative hire could be anywhere. We also believe the most in-demand knowledge workers today want to leverage a global career perspective, the freedom to live where they want, and the security of full-fledged employment with benefits. But today, the flow between talent and opportunity around the globe is still blocked by the costs and legal complexity companies face before they can fully employ in another country. Cross-border hiring is still arcane, remarkably un-transformed by software, and ripe for disruption. We are also motivated by the opportunity for positive social impact. Removing these barriers makes the world a better place in three ways: 1) It helps redress inequalities of access to opportunity, 2) It allows for the distribution of wealth to places other than the major cities of the world, and 3) It supports the environmentally-friendly and business-smart shift to remote working. Our software platform is created to solve for the complexities of giving full-time, full-fledged employment to anyone in the world, while providing a delightful experience to employers and employees.

The company provides growers, master-gardeners and novices with engineered products and performance materials that enhance plant and crop performance. The benefits of Growstone products include improved yields, disease protection, and environmental safety. The performance advantages of Growstone products become even more compelling when considering the fact that as a sustainable and environmentally friendly product, it does not present the negative impacts on the environment that are common to alternative solutions and competitive products. At the core of Growstone\'s product offering is its proprietary foam glass material which has been independently verified through scientific testing by two of the world\'s leading agricultural universities to meet or exceed the crop performance of competitive products. Foamed glass is a specialty performance material produced from the processing of recycled glass that would otherwise be sent to a landfill. The manufacturing process allows Growstone to produce foamed glass with a wide range of characteristics to meet the specific needs of targeted market segments. The manufacturing process allows the company to alter the porosity, cell size, color, product size, and compressive strength of the finished product with a consistent chemical composition. Plant root systems thrive in this environment as the foamed glass substrate (Growstones) retains water, nutrients and oxygen at the root system level.

At Phanes, we bring innovation that illuminates the path to cure. Cancer cells cunningly evade the immune system using many different mechanisms. We believe that only when the full potential of the human immune system is unleashed, tumors can be effectively treated or even cured. One of our therapeutic approaches is to boost both the innate and adaptive immunity with monoclonal antibodies and bispecific antibodies. We are also interrogating non-immune pathways that may play key roles in the tumor microenvironment for their potential in developing novel therapeutics. In addition to a strong pipeline, Phanes has developed disruptive technologies that enable drug discovery.

Our mission is to lower costs in the laboratory industry and reduce biohazard waste in the environment by delivering groundbreaking approaches in dealing with plastic consumables.

The typical laboratory consumes several thousand pipette tips every day for samples and assay procedures, due to the lack of options for safely cleaning plastic consumables. Such high consumption of plastic tips adds $25,000 to $1.5 million in annual operational costs for laboratories worldwide. At Grenova™, we know that high consumption of plastic tips is an excessive, avoidable operational cost for companies and a significant contributor to environmental pollution. This is why we decided to create devices that enable labs to wash and recycle pipette tips in large quantities. Grenova devices offer labs the option to reuse plastic tips several times, cutting associated costs by up to 90%.
